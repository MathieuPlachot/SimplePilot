This is a Simple GPS based tiller pilot project (In Progress).

The control unit:
* Retrieves route data from an NMEA compatible GPS
* Computes the command to be applied to the actuator connected to the tiller
  
It is written in Python and tested on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.

The user interface allows to:
* Visualize current mode (AUTO/MANU)
* Visualize current GPS route
* Visualize and set target GPS route
  
It is written in Flutter and tested on Android.
